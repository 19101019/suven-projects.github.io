under the internship program of suven consultants and technology , I completed a project under the following  instructions :-     In this simple project, youâ€™ll be breaking apart some of the popular CSS3 design modules. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles. Your job is to create a website that includes the modules described in the documentation.
